The Daily Dale Current Affairs, Gossip, and Weather TRADE TENSION ENDS IN BREMEN Tensions have been high in Bremen over the past few weeks between the recently crowned King of the Lac, his grace Barnaby St. Clyde I , and Speaker Shalescar , due to the embargo on fishing imposed by the former on the Maer Dualdon town stead. After weeks of nautical espionage conducted by His Grace , a parlay between the rival leaders took place on the Bremen dockside where a heated altercation took place between the secretary of the Speaker, one Petunia REDACTED, verbally accosted the newly crowned king, calling His Grace a \u201cbig grey idiot\u201d and \u201ca handless gay\u201d. Shocking onlookers, the usually reserved Speaker leaned out of his palanquin and struck the cheeky secretary a mighty swat about the ear. After a rocky start, the meeting of minds on the docks took a further four hours of intense back and forth, The King arguing for the denizens of the lac , and the speaker for the townsfolk throughout the dale dependent on Bremen \u2019s fishing supply. The agreement decided upon was as follows: the people of Bremen are free to fish the Lac as required provided that the townsfolk provide regular entertainments on the shoreside for the king to enjoy. These frivolities must include, but are not limited to juggling, poetry readings, pig races/rodeo, and theatrical performances of local events where at least some of the participants are dressed as fish. As hand shook fin a cheer rose from the crowd and groups hurried off to prepare fishing gear and performance kit alike. When asked for comment His Grace the King of the Lac said \u201cIt\u2019s great to see so many fans out here today, it was a great match, solid performance from everyone involved and has really set us up nicely for the season\u201d. It is unclear what this means, thought this reporter is sure that the understanding of this, and many other of His Grace \u2019s musings will be revealed in his upcoming biography, available at most reputable general stores. - Tali , Wildlife researcher and Royal biographer. BUGBEAR MERCS RECRUIT MEMBER The region\u2019s newest mercenary group, The Three Bugbear-teers , has gained a new member, though this newbie is not of the gobloid persuasion, but is, in fact, a member of the post life community. Krintaas the Wight hails from \u201cages ago\u201d and is the former bodyguard of the criminal wizard Dzaan the Red . He lost touch with his former employer when Dzaan \u201cturned into a pile of black goo\u201d while walking in the wilderness, an event about which Krintaas refused to comment further. As regular readers of the Dale Daily will know, The Red Wizard was put to death in the town of Easthaven for the crime of multiple murder, killing a group of adventurers whom he had hired to assist him, another topic which the hulking Krintaas was reticent to divulge upon. When asked for comment, the leader of the Bugbear-teers , Brekk , said \u201cHe can reach the top shelves and doesn\u2019t eat so we keep him. If he tries to goo us too we\u2019d clogger him good and piss his bones\u201d after which he pulled off Krintaas \u2019 left arm and threw it into the bushes, causing the wight to bashfully retrieve it. The Three Bugbear-teers (plus Krintaas ) can usually be found in Bryn Shander and the connected towns, available to hire at competitive prices for guaranteed results with minimal mess. - Robert , #Bugbear GOBLINS GOBLINS GOBLINS GOBLINS Lock away your daughters, for the green menace is rising!! No #Chicken coop, na\u00efve merchant, or unattended baby is safe! Speakers throughout the Dale have been idle in their suppression of the vermin menace that has grown to disgusting proportions in recent months and the fruit of this indolence is being reaped on every quiet track and woodland copse. Not since the summer of 65DR has the #Goblin threat been so prominent in the region, with many suspecting that the squat freaks have gathered in some sort of society in the mountains under some ghastly leader. I shudder to think of the world our children will grow up into.

After weeks of nautical espionage conducted by His Grace , a parlay between the rival leaders took place on the Bremen dockside where a heated altercation took place between the secretary of the Speaker, one Petunia REDACTED, verbally accosted the newly crowned king, calling His Grace a \u201cbig grey idiot\u201d and \u201ca handless gay\u201d. Shocking onlookers, the usually reserved Speaker leaned out of his palanquin and struck the cheeky secretary a mighty swat about the ear. After a rocky start, the meeting of minds on the docks took a further four hours of intense back and forth, The King arguing for the denizens of the lac , and the speaker for the townsfolk throughout the dale dependent on Bremen \u2019s fishing supply. The agreement decided upon was as follows: the people of Bremen are free to fish the Lac as required provided that the townsfolk provide regular entertainments on the shoreside for the king to enjoy. These frivolities must include, but are not limited to juggling, poetry readings, pig races/rodeo, and theatrical performances of local events where at least some of the participants are dressed as fish. As hand shook fin a cheer rose from the crowd and groups hurried off to prepare fishing gear and performance kit alike. When asked for comment His Grace the King of the Lac said \u201cIt\u2019s great to see so many fans out here today, it was a great match, solid performance from everyone involved and has really set us up nicely for the season\u201d. It is unclear what this means, thought this reporter is sure that the understanding of this, and many other of His Grace \u2019s musings will be revealed in his upcoming biography, available at most reputable general stores. - Tali , Wildlife researcher and Royal biographer.","title":"TRADE TENSION ENDS IN BREMEN"},{"location":"Items/The%20Daily%20Dale%20No1/#bugbear-mercs-recruit-member","text":"The region\u2019s newest mercenary group, The Three Bugbear-teers , has gained a new member, though this newbie is not of the gobloid persuasion, but is, in fact, a member of the post life community. Krintaas the Wight hails from \u201cages ago\u201d and is the former bodyguard of the criminal wizard Dzaan the Red . He lost touch with his former employer when Dzaan \u201cturned into a pile of black goo\u201d while walking in the wilderness, an event about which Krintaas refused to comment further. As regular readers of the Dale Daily will know, The Red Wizard was put to death in the town of Easthaven for the crime of multiple murder, killing a group of adventurers whom he had hired to assist him, another topic which the hulking Krintaas was reticent to divulge upon. When asked for comment, the leader of the Bugbear-teers , Brekk , said \u201cHe can reach the top shelves and doesn\u2019t eat so we keep him. If he tries to goo us too we\u2019d clogger him good and piss his bones\u201d after which he pulled off Krintaas \u2019 left arm and threw it into the bushes, causing the wight to bashfully retrieve it.

The Daily Dale Current Affairs, Gossip, and Weather DRAGON CALAMITY SUNDERS DALE!!!!!!!! DEATH TOLL UNCOUNTABLE Early yesterday morning a terrible cry was heard in Dougan's Hole . From somewhere in the mountains of the Spine of The World , the night quiet was broken by the cry of a terrible mechanical beast. The dragon that has so damaged all our lives and livelihoods first descended on Dougan's Hole before descending upon Good Mead , Easthaven , Caer Dineval , Caer Konig , Termalaine and Lonelywood . A brief account of the events in each of the mentioned towns is as follows: Dougan's Hole Every structure in the town was destroyed, barring the famous Stones of Thruun . Twenty-five of the total fifty residents perished, though the remaining survivors, including Speaker Durmoot escaped to Bryn Shander . Good Mead Every structure except the mead hall was destroyed. Twenty-five, one quarter of the township, hid in the nearby woods to escape the dragon before making their way to Bryn Shander . Easthaven Approximately half of the buildings in Easthaven have been destroyed, including the White Lady Inn , the Wet Trout , and the docks. Among the dead are Captain Aggie of the town guard, Boatman Boathands , Minerva Myskjin (proprietor of the Wet Trout ), and Speaker Daveth Waylen (who was killed not by the dragon, but by several #Duergar searching the town hall, looking for who knows what). Ricardo the Sultry was badly injured but intends to restore and run the White Lady Inn , should he be presented the chance. Caer Dineval The only survivors of the attack on Caer Dineval were those lucky enough to be within the castle walls. The dragon seemed only interested in destroying the rest of the town, barely glancing at the castle as it spent an hour in everywhere else. Many of the townsfolk were murdered by a band of #Duergar emerging from the seemingly abandoned tavern, Dinev's Rest , including the much beloved Hamhands Jig , owner of the Uphill Climb . Caer Konig The tragedy of Caer Konig was not that every building in town was destroyed. It was not that the sisters Annie and Allie were killed when The Northern Light collapsed upon them. It was not that Atenas Swift of Frozenfar Expeditions was killed when trying to save people with his dog sleds. The tragedy of Caer Konig was that as the town was destroyed, it\u2019s speaker and greatest fighter Tovus was asleep, drunk in a snow heap outside town. Long may his shame endure. Fortunately, the taciturn Jarthur had assembled his magnificent airship and managed to save fifty people using netting and ropes to carry more than his balloon could usually carry. Termalaine The townsfolk of Termalaine fled both to Bremen , across Maer Dualdon , and into the gem mines at the northwest of the town. After six hours, the dragon could not oust those hiding in the mine . After it had departed though, duergar saboteurs emerged and collapsed the entrance to the mine , and the survivors are still trapped within. Lonelywood Lonelywood has faired perhaps the best of any of the towns destroyed. While every building there has been demolished, their close proximity to Termalaine and the easy escape route of the maer meant that all the residents of Lonelywood knew of the dragon\u2019s imminent attack and could escape to Bremen before the beast reached them. Bremen It was at Bremen that the dragon met it\u2019s end. The heroes of the group Larry's Folk assisted in evacuating the town before making their stand against the creature, using strength and magic to destroy the beast before it could do any more harm. The people of Tentowns can do little to repay this deed.

The gang decide this is enough justification and the cult must be stopped, they restore the speaker's health and go to see Kaldroth . Immediately Don Fyre casts a silence spell and so the only choice is melee combat, which Depeche and Raisin quickly take care of, Kaldroth dies. As he dies his body is encased in ice. After this the gang systematically take out most of the cult, sparing any townspeople that were in service of the cult not by choice. Depeche instructs his horrible dead goblin ghost to find and kill anyone wearing the Levistus Amulet , and off it goes. Reaching the Scrannon Desieve 's room, the gang find the guard in the room with the speaker hostage, and urge them to very quickly take off the amulet if they want to live. They aqcuiese in a panic and immediately turn to a block of ice. The gang then head into the basement to explore, and find a tiefling woman, Avarice , writing in a book. She is annoyed that they have killed the cult but only because she will have to find another place to do her work, and that if the gang did kill the cult then it was Levistus ' will.

He is nowhere to be found, and Duvessa Shane says she can no longer spare any help, Marc is on the battlements. Depeche convinces her it's too important to not help, and she is convinced, allowing the gang to ask him to join you. The gang look for and find Marc on the walls, trying to convince him, he is fine with sparing the three guards but not convinced the town could spare himself. Depeche is unsucessful in making the case, leaving Marc on the fence. Don Fyre convinces him to flip a coin to make the decision, and it lands in favour of him joining us. He summons Jimothy , Lucille , and Craig . Guards and Marc in tow, the gang mount up on the axebeaks, and stow Soren in the cart with the guards.

They also find a sympathetic Duergar, Grandolpha Muzgardt who wants Zardarok dead so wants to help the gang. Some of the Duergar in Sunblight are on her side. It is a temporary alliance in the grand scheme of things but now is not the time. More traps and more shitty treasure. Finding the second elevator, the gang is attacked by some animated plate armour.

The gang find an office with a stone desk, locked drawers. Don fails to pick the locks and delcares them locked by \"Arcane Magicks\" The gang smash the desk to bits, finding 20 gold and a notebook owned by a Nephrun , detailing troop movements and stations, and a note, Zardarok thinks I'm plotting, if only I knew who was so I could stop them. The gang decides against a short rest, due to time constraints. Entering a room the gang finds a metal map of tentowns, with a little metal Chardalyn dragon on top of Sunblight .

Don attempts to get the trap to stop by reading the scroll out at it. Raising also tries this. Depeche jams the smoking jacket in the gas hole, and traps himself in a cupboard. The cupboard is a strange shrine with 7 skulls and a naked, bald, duergar woman with no facial features. Soren replaces the smoking jacket with the furs from the bed. Raisin replaces the furs with a balloon. Depeche attempts to take the statue and run, but it is cursed Chardalyn and so is psychically hurt a lot, and so drops and it and cowers in the corner of the cupboard. Soren rushes in and heals Depeche. Don wraps up the statue and stashes it. He identifies it as a depiction of the Deep Duerra . The gang gangs up to heal depeche. Pressing further the gang finds a hole that could fit a dragon going from underground right out to the top of Sunblight. Entering another room the gang encounters some Duerger Chefs and an old woman. Grandolpha Muzgardt , offers the gang some food, consisting of a big brain with legs. She has a miniature version of the Chardalyn Dragon as a defender.

A while down the road they encounter a bunch of ice sculptures, lovingly rendered forms of various animals in noble poses, the ice in the sculptures is crystal clear and the weather seems to pass around them. Stchorpo says that they are all carved by the Frost Maiden herself. The gang ponder them for a while, trying to decide whether to vandalise them, they weigh up the benefits of potentially angering the Frost Maiden , and discuss whether she actually is behind this whole mess. At some point during this discussion, Depeche suddenly starts performing an ad hoc funeral for Rickets , laying him down in an auspicious spot, and setting him alight. Soren steps in and consecrates this funeral, and much sorrow and mourning was had by all, I'm sure. Back on the road the gang come upon gigantic steps hewn from the ice, leading up to a giant skull shaped fortress: Grimskalle . After a brief discussion they decide to continue with their course of action, heading to the shipwreck . A little further down the road there is another sculpture park, much the same as the first. The gang depart the sculpture park and decide to trust Zhorpo again, following him to a shipwreck full of treasure. The treasure in question turns out to be giant oysters, with nary a pearl. The Oysters were #mild and #salty More road, more sculpture parks. This time however, the statues are cloudy, and there is something making noise from within. Depeche and Manajam try to stealthily investigate, but Depeche is spotted by an #Ice-Troll who is trying to munch on some frozen corpses. The gang swiftly dispatch the troll, but take some considerable damage in the process. Manajam eats its heart. After departing this park, the gang for some reason, once again listen to Schlorpo and check out yet another shipwreck . This one however does happen to contain something interesting. After Manajam and Raisin use brute force to launch a cat onto the boat, they learn that upon it is a #Walrus, who has a bottle on a string around its neck. It is playing happily, sliding down a naturally formed ice slide over and over. Depeche swims over to attempt to retrieve the bottle, fails once again to be stealthy, and is surprisingly greeted by the #Walrus. They converse and learn that this is yet another awakened creature, by a mysterious #druid. The description seems to fit that of Ravisin . She did not give him a name, and so Depeche grants him the name of Jimjohn . He learns that Jimjohn was told to guard Angajuck's Bell , attacking anyone who came near it, but that wasn't the life for him and so he's here. In celebration of their friendship, Jimjohn gifts Depeche the potion. After the glorious acquisition of treasure, Zorpo leads on, and the gang finally make it to the boat they set out to see. They begin investigating, they find no signs of survivors. Manajam , however, finds a neat orb and immediately touches it. It causes a #ghost to come out and try possess him, but upon failing the ghost pleads with him to let her do it. It turns out it's Nass Lantomir , she's died and her ghost is trapped near the corpse unless she possesses someone. Vellynne Harpell seems pretty smug about her comrade being dead, and she takes the orb. The orb turns out to be Skant . The gang discuss solutions to Nass Lantomir 's problem, including ressurecting Don Fyre , inhabiting her own corpse raised from the dead, finding Sthorpo and forcing him to allow her in, attempting to exist in the background of Depeche 's mind, and simply bringing Nass Lantomir 's corpse along.
