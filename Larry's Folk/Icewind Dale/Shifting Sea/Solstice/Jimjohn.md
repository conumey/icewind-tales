# Jimjohn 

An awakened #Walrus found on a shipwreck on the coast of [[Grimskalle]]. Said he was awakened by a druid, presumably [[Ravisin]], and told to attack people who came to investigate the bell on the coast of the [[Shifting Sea]], but he "sacked it off", and found a great ice slide. She gave him no name, and so [[Depeche]] named him [[Jimjohn]].

As a gift to a friend he gave [[Depeche]] the potion he had on a string around his neck.
