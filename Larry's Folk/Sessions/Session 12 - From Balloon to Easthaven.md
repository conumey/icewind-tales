# Session 12 - From Balloon to Easthaven
#### 2022-01-25 / 5th to 6th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Don Fyre]]

## Session Summary
[[Jarthur]] performs his balloon tricks, level 1 and level 2, everyone is amazed. He talks of a balloon level 3 but would need supplies from a man called [[Boffy]] in [[Easthaven]], and it would cost 500g. 
The gang rest up, presumably, and head on their way to [[Easthaven]]. When they arrive there is an execution taking place, which [[Don Fyre]] attempts to interrupt, but is unsuccessful. The gang are apprehended and taken to the [[Easthaven Town Hall]], where Town Speaker [[Daveth Waylen]] questions them. The gang agree to undertake a task for the town in order to repair their standing. Some fishermen [[Gobber Murder]] and [[Humphbert Scripp]] have gone missing and the gang is to find and deal with whatever is the cause, [[Missing Fishermen]].
Once released the gang encounter [[Milboil]] who after some pontificating, challenges them to a hunting contest, a Red Yeti has been spotted and the first to find it will win 200g from the other party, the contest begins tomorrow morning.
A quick visit to [[White Lady Inn]] has the gang meeting [[Bartaban]] and [[Ricardo the Sultry]] who plays a pretty tune, and tells the gang about a seance he is hosting at midnight, [[Lac Dinneshere Treasure]].
The gang cross the frozen lake and find a [[Hag Cave]], in which they encounter harpies and fight them.
