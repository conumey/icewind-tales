# 35 - Octopode and Unrelated Trickery
#### 2022-08-30 / 18th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Depeche]], [[Jory]], [[Vellynne Harpell]], [[Manajam]]

## Session Summary
Continuing their underwater journey, the gang attempt to, and succeed in catching an octopus as a tasty treat for [[Angajuck]], who in turn changes course and heads straight to [[Grimskalle]]. On the way the gang debate about throwing [[Don Fyre]]'s body overboard but decide against it for unknown reasons.

[[Raisin]] performs some minor autosurgery, badly injuring herself and freeing a parasite that had been growing inside her. It tries to escape but has nowhere to go, and is quickly dispatched and [[Raisin]] is patched up. To allow her to recover the gang take a rest before emerging into the icy waters around [[Grimskalle]].

Embarking onto the island the gang are greeted by an ice creature who introduces himself as [[Schlorpo]], he offers to guide the group around the island, and tells them of a recent shipwreck, which the gang assume is the ship of [[Nass Lantomir]].
