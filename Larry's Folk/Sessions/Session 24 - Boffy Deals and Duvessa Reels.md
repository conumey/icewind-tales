# Session 24 - Boffy Deals and Duvessa Reels
#### 2022-05-31 / 11th to 12th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Depeche]], [[Don Fyre]]

## Session Summary
Returning to [[Caer Dineval]] after apprehending [[Shrodney Mulphoon]] and killing the other escapee, questioned Shrodney and let him return to [[Bremen]] to be a fish dancer, and slept for the night.
Heading to [[Easthaven]] to go see [[Boffy]] to try broker a deal for [[Jarthur]]'s balloon venture, it is successful but no thanks to the gang. [[Depeche]] buys some tricks from [[Boffy]]. [[Boffy]] tells the gang he sacrificed his feelings to overcome limits of magic, and is hiding as a clown to avoid doing anything. Heading to [[Easthaven Town Hall]] the gang convinces [[Daveth Waylen]] to allow them to take the giant [[Chardalyn]] crystal, which they first purify and smash to pieces, they also half convince the speaker to reward them if they become speaker of [[Targos]].
Talk to speaker asking you to kill the goblins at [[Goblin Fortress]], and we tell her of the bad things [[Narth Maximum]] is doing and she agrees to call a council of speakers to discuss it with them.
Decided to go to to Sunblight first and told her about it and their plans to use a powerful weapon to destroy [[Ten-Towns]], she offered the armoury and [[Marc]] and a number of guards to help.
