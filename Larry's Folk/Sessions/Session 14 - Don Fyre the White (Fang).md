# Don Fyre the White (Fang)
## Session 
#### 2022-02-16 / 6th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Worb]]

## Session Summary
The fight with [[Maud]] and [[Don Fyre]] is resolved when the Hag is killed and [[Don Fyre]] is allowed to escape, told to run into the wilderness, which he does. The gang retrieve the body parts of [[Gobber Murder]] and [[Humphbert Scripp]], [[Missing Fishermen]], and also decide to take the decidely fancy looking [[Cauldron of Plenty]].

Upon returning to [[Easthaven]], [[Daveth Waylen]] thanks the gang for their service and despite his better judgement gives them a reward, a [[Bag of Tricks, Grey]]. It belonged to the person who was executed, who he says was called Red Wizard [[Dzaan]].

[[Daveth Waylen]] offers to buy the [[Cauldron of Plenty]] for 2500g, as long as the gang agree to guard it overnight tomorrow night, as he has a feeling someone will try steal it. The gang agrees, planning to return at nightfall the following day, [[Guard the Cauldron]].

The gang head back to [[White Lady Inn]] for the seance, [[Ricardo the Sultry]] successfully channels a spirit that grants the answer to three questions. The gang squander the questions massively and [[Ricardo the Sultry]] is annoyed they didn't ask about the treasure.
Long rest in the inn.
