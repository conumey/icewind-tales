# Tour of Destruction
## Session 
#### 2022-07-13 / 14-15th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Don Fyre]], [[Depeche]], [[Vellynne Harpell]]

## Session Summary
The gang attempt to reach the [[Chardalyn Dragon]] on its tour of destruction, contacting various people who might be able to help. Only [[Boffy]] comes through, and helps them with a leg of the journey. 

They head from their teleport destination of [[Easthaven]] to [[Bryn Shander]] where they meet up with [[Marc]], swap their tired axebeaks out for the ones Marc took previously and set out towards [[Targos]]. On the road they encounter someone riding [[Fastbeak]], which [[Depeche]] requisitions. Reaching [[Targos]], the speaker attempts to recruit the gang into the local militia but fails, as they head on to [[Bremen]]. 

They prepare to fight the dragon, evacuating the town and any stragglers that have arrived across the lake in the process.
