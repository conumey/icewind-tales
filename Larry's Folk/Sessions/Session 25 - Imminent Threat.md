# Session 25 - Imminent Threat
#### 2022-06-07 / 12th to 14th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Don Fyre]], [[Depeche]]

## Session Summary
After making [[Duvessa Shane]] aware of [[Zardarok's Weapon]], the gang make their preparations for taking on [[Sunblight]]. [[Soren]] creating new armours and the rest mostly resting.
After some upset about the delay, [[Duvessa Shane]]'s offer of help seemed off the table but the gang turned it around.
[[Marc]], [[Jimothy]], [[Lucille]], and [[Craig]] joined the gang on their journey. With [[Marc]]'s knowledge of the area they found a good place to cross the river and headed into the mountains, scaling a trodden path up and over a peak and round into the valley where [[Sunblight]] sits. 
They were too late however, as on the approach to the fortress, a great [[Chardalyn Dragon]] rose from the fortress and took flight, heading for [[Bryn Shander]]. [[Marc]] and company departed to help the town despite [[Depeche]]'s plea.
The gang, undeterred from their goal, entered the fortress, whre they met an alarming amount of duergar resistance.

## Log

- Start in square of Bryn Shander
- [[Duvessa Shane]] is agitated and sends guards to the walls in case [[Zardarok]] and the duergar attack
- Head to Armoury, some half plate available, a lot of the gear is in a bad way.
- [[Soren]] plans to make full plate by salvaging other armours
- [[Duvessa Shane]] is upset we're not leaving immediately, she's very unreasonable
- [[Soren]] smiths the full plate, at [[Blackiron Blades]], [[Garn]] helps
- The gang plans to rest while he smiths and have him rest on the way to [[Sunblight]], [[Zardarok's Weapon]]
- [[Depeche]] gets a slight armour upgrade, imbues a Fly shardalyn and sleeps all day by the warmth of the forge. [[Don Fyre]] sleeps also, part of the time as a weasel.
- [[Raisin]] goes to see [[Scramsquash]] to try find out where [[Jimmy P]] is, he's apparently on his way to [[Targos]].
- Work finished, the gang reconvene, and head to the [[Bryn Shander Town Hall]] to try recruit [[Marc]] for the journey. He is nowhere to be found, and [[Duvessa Shane]] says she can no longer spare any help, [[Marc]] is on the battlements. [[Depeche]] convinces her it's too important to not help, and she is convinced, allowing the gang to ask him to join you.
- The gang look for and find [[Marc]] on the walls, trying to convince him, he is fine with sparing the three guards but not convinced the town could spare himself. [[Depeche]] is unsucessful in making the case, leaving [[Marc]] on the fence. [[Don Fyre]] convinces him to flip a coin to make the decision, and it lands in favour of him joining us. He summons [[Jimothy]], [[Lucille]], and [[Craig]].
- Guards and [[Marc]] in tow, the gang mount up on the axebeaks, and stow [[Soren]] in the cart with the guards. 
- Reaching the Redrun bridge takes 7.5 hours taking us into the next day, but is uneventful. Another 5 hours to the crossing point of the river [[Marc]] tells us about, and the axebeaks are fatigued. The gang rests before attempting to cross the river, but not before [[Don Fyre]] jumps in the river to test depth, it's cold and 2 meters deep.
- Long rest
- [[Soren]] casts a ritual to allow the axebeaks to walk on water, and [[Raisin]] uses a spell scroll to create a floating disc to get the cart across and the crossing goes smoothly.
- 7 Hours to get to the mountain pass, 2am of the next day.
- An hour to climb to the peak, a shelf-like path curls around and out of view.
- Depeche and Don scout ahead and decide it is prudent to press on.
- 2 hours later we reach the fortress
- A great dragon made from [[Chardalyn]] emerges from the fortress, and flies at great speed towards [[Tentowns]], despite urging from [[Depeche]] to stay, [[Marc]] leaves with his guards, taking 4 axebeaks, to do what they can for [[Bryn Shander]].
- Leaving the packbeaks at the bottom of the stairs, the party climbs the stairs to the fortress.
- A featureless locked door bars the way, but [[Depeche]] uses Mage Hand to go in through an arrow slit.
- Don spots something through an arrow slit in the entryway and decides to try and just walk past, but [[Depeche]] positions to quickly fire a blast through.
- Fight ensues. There's a lot of duergar good god.
- Session ends mid fight.
