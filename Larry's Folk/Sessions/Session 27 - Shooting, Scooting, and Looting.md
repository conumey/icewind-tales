# Session 27 - Shooting, Scooting, and Looting
#### 2022-06-28 / 14th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Don Fyre]], [[Depeche]]

## Session Summary
The gang venture down in the fortress, immediately finding [[Zardarok]] in a shrine to the [[Deep Duerra]], he is immediately destroyed. Tied to the statue is a #Mind-Flayer, [[F'yorl]] who has had part of his brain removed so he can't do magic.
The gang frees him and hands him some flasks of alchemic fire to help in a fight, and then they will help him return to the #Underdark. 
They enter a room where [[F'yorl]] said a monster lurked, the one who took his brain. The gang take no chances and go in guns blazing, literally. In the room is a #Duergar, who after being attacked is revealed to be a demon in disguise. It is dispatched without mercy.
After a short rest, the gang enacts a plan to don disguises and enter the forge, with [[Depeche]] disguised as [[Zardarok]] thanks to [[Boffy]]'s magic disguise, despite no-one being able to take him seriously the gang manage to destroy the dragon heart in the forge, and make their way to the treasure room, looting ensues.

## Log
- Start at 6:15am.
- Go down the lift, immediately attacked by a #Duergar in an exoskeleton.
- [[Don Fyre]] puts them to sleep and we flee the room.
- [[Zardarok]] is in here, praying to a shrine of the [[Deep Duerra]], which has a #Mind-Flayer  strapped to it.
- [[Zardarok]] is honestly destroyed in a pathetic fashion.
- Gang talks to the #Mind-Flayer, [[F'yorl]], who says the "monster" in the room next door took part of his brain.

- [[Depeche]] tries to free [[F'yorl]] and accidentally chops off a hand.
- They form up against the door and decide to attack with no warning, which they do, bursting through and taking shots.
- Inside is a duergar who gets hit a couple of times, then transforms into Sean Gunn, and the gang keep attacking.
- [[F'yorl]] tries his best.
- It is 6:30am.
- The gang short rests.
- It is 7:30am.
- Plan is formed to escort prisoner, disguised as duergar and animals, to try sneak through the fort.
- The plan is confusing but works surprisingly well, the gang kill the heart without raising suspicion, and then go to leave.
- In the room to the east of the forge there are guards, in front of the treasure room.
- The guards are convinced to leave depsite nearly seeing through [[Depeche]]'s guise.
- One of the chests has a mouldy skeleton but no-one gets hurt.
