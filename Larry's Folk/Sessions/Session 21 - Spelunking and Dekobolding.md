# Spelunking and Dekobolding
## Session 
#### 2022-04-26 / 10th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Worb]], [[Depeche]]

## Session Summary
The gang enter the mine and do indeed find evidence of Kobold activity. Despite attempts to talk they end up fighting and killing one, but on next encounter they manage to open a dialog. The leader of the Kobolds, [[Trex]] says they are peaceful and just want to work in the mines, he is lying in some way but [[Depeche]] ignores this and agrees to set up a meeting between them and [[Orus Mashtew]]. The Kobolds very reluctantly agree.
Before they head out though, the gang search the mine more for the power source, and find a powerful and strange creature, killing it, they find the power source inside a skull in the cavern where it made its lair. [[Alien Sex Zoogaloo]].
Leaving the mine they talk to [[Orus Mashtew]] and offer either the chance for a meeting with the Kobolds or to use the meeting as an ambush and massacre them. This is resolved somehow.
The gang leave town and head back to the ship, but on their way they bump into the [[White Wyrm]], accidentally engaging it in combat and immediately being dealt mortal wounds. Just before death though a voice offers to save them in return for servitude, the entire gang agrees and they are saved as well as being incredibly powerful. Around everyone's neck is a [[Levistus Amulet]]. The gang mostly decide to use their power to run to safety, but [[Depeche]] chases the [[White Wyrm]] and nearly kills but, but it flies up to escape. The power subsides, but the amulet remains, [[Cult of Levistus]].
