## Session Summary
After a rest to recover from their big fight with the yetis, the gang set out along the road, vowing never to trust [[Schlorpo]] again. 

A while down the road they encounter a bunch of ice sculptures, lovingly rendered forms of various animals in noble poses, the ice in the sculptures is crystal clear and the weather seems to pass around them. [[Schlorpo|Stchorpo]] says that they are all carved by the [[Frost Maiden]] herself. The gang ponder them for a while, trying to decide whether to vandalise them, they weigh up the benefits of potentially angering the [[Frost Maiden]], and discuss whether she actually is behind this whole mess. 

At some point during this discussion, [[Depeche]] suddenly starts performing an ad hoc funeral for [[Rickets]], laying him down in an auspicious spot, and setting him alight. [[Soren]] steps in and consecrates this funeral, and much sorrow and mourning was had by all, I'm sure.

Back on the road the gang come upon gigantic steps hewn from the ice, leading up to a giant skull shaped fortress: [[Grimskalle]]. After a brief discussion they decide to continue with their course of action, heading to [[Boat Wreck No2|the shipwreck]]. 

A little further down the road there is another sculpture park, much the same as the first.

The gang depart the sculpture park and decide to trust [[Schlorpo|Zhorpo]] again, following him to a [[Boat Wreck No3|shipwreck]] full of treasure. The treasure in question turns out to be giant oysters, with nary a pearl.

More road, more sculpture parks. This time however, the statues are cloudy, and there is something making noise from within. [[Depeche]] and [[Manajam]] try to stealthily investigate, but [[Depeche]] is spotted by an #Ice-Troll who is trying to munch on some frozen corpses. The gang swiftly dispatch the troll, but take some considerable damage in the process. [[Manajam]] eats its heart.

After departing this park, the gang for some reason, once again listen to [[Schlorpo]] and check out yet another [[Boat Wreck No4|shipwreck]]. This one however does happen to contain something interesting. After [[Manajam]] and [[Raisin]] use brute force to launch a cat onto the boat, they learn that upon it is a #Walrus, who has a bottle on a string around its neck. It is playing happily, sliding down a naturally formed ice slide over and over. 

[[Depeche]] swims over to attempt to retrieve the bottle, fails once again to be stealthy, and is surprisingly greeted by the #Walrus. They converse and learn that this is yet another awakened creature, by a mysterious #druid. The description seems to fit that of [[Ravisin]]. She did not give him a name, and so [[Depeche]] grants him the name of [[Jimjohn]]. He learns that [[Jimjohn]] was told to guard [[Angajuck's Bell]], attacking anyone who came near it, but that wasn't the life for him and so he's here. In celebration of their friendship, [[Jimjohn]] gifts [[Depeche]] the potion.

After the glorious acquisition of treasure, [[Schlorpo|Zorpo]] leads on, and the gang finally make it to the [[Boat Wreck No2|boat]] they set out to see. They begin investigating, they find no signs of survivors. [[Manajam]], however, finds a neat orb and immediately touches it. It causes a #ghost to come out and try possess him, but upon failing the ghost pleads with him to let her do it. 

It turns out it's [[Nass Lantomir]], she's died and her ghost is trapped near the corpse unless she possesses someone. [[Vellynne Harpell]] seems pretty smug about her comrade being dead, and she takes the orb. The orb turns out to be [[Skant]]. The gang discuss solutions to [[Nass Lantomir]]'s problem, including ressurecting [[Don Fyre]], inhabiting her own corpse raised from the dead, finding [[Schlorpo|Sthorpo]] and forcing him to allow her in, attempting to exist in the background of [[Depeche]]'s mind, and simply bringing [[Nass Lantomir]]'s corpse along. [[Vellynne Harpell]] tries to convince them not to do any of those.

As they are discussing, the roar from earlier sounds out again, this time closer. It seems to be heading straight for the gang, and so they quickly spring into action, setting up a quick ambush. [[Schlorpo|Szcorpo]] arrives with a giant #Yeti, clearly having led it straight to us, the bastard.
