# Session 19 - Balloon Balloon Spaceship
#### 2022-04-12 / 8th to 9th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Worb]]

## Session Summary
En route to [[Caer Konig]] the gang encounter and defeat some kind of Cold Light Creature, it is carrying a wooden ball from one of the town's sacrifice lottery, [[Where the Sun Gone]].
The gang deliver [[Balloon 3]] to [[Jarthur]] and he is esctatic, showing them it immediately, it is a transcendent experience. [[Raisin]] convinces [[Jarthur]] to teach him balloon magic, and so he joins the gang in their travels. The gang rests at the [[The Northern Light]].
A strange nondescript 'pull' is urging [[Worb]] north and the gang have no other plans so they head that way.
They stumble upon a strange craft, crash landed in the wastes, heading towards it they are attacked by large land fish, which they kill. Inside the craft they find strange small creatures and a large hulking monster, which attacks. The gang has a feeling and leaves the small creatures alive, which is good because a friendly Mind Flayer, [[Goppo]] runs in and halts the fight, is disappointed that the monster is dead but is glad the small creatures live.
He beckons the gang upstairs into the warmer part of the ship, where [[Flubber]] awaits, the captain of the ship. They explain they are not of this world, and they travel finding creatures for their intergalactic sex zoo, [[Alien Sex Zoogaloo]], but they crashed and cannot repair their ship without a new power source, and since they can't survive in the cold they cannot retrieve one. The gang agree to help and [[Worb]] even buys some extra time by tinkering with the ships engine to prolong what little life support time is left. The aliens give the gang a cube which acts as a proximity sensor for the power source they need and points them in the direction of [[Termalaine]].
