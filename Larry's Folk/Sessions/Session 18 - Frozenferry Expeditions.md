# Session 18 - Frozenferry Expeditions
#### 2022-03-29 / 8th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Worb]]

## Session Summary
The gang go to [[Boffy's Joke Shop]] to pay for and pick up various bits, including [[Balloon 3]]. [[Boffy]] immediately sees through the fake money and tells them it will turn to sludge in no time at all, and that [[Dzaan]] has a fairly low chance of surviving a sludging as well, [[Dzaan is Dzead]].
Before heading out the gang decide to investigate the [[Frozen Ferry]] mentioned in the [[Duergar Letter]]. On the ferry they find a single duergar, presumably [[Durth]] and kill him. More duergar show up however and the gang try to hide but fail miserably and have to fight more, this time they leave one alive and question her. She answers their questions in return for being spared. She tells them about [[Sunblight]], and about [[Zardarok]] who is the leader of the duergar. His aim is to create a weapon to destroy [[Tentowns]] so that the duergar can take over [[Zardarok's Weapon]]. He's using the [[Forge of Sunblight]], which is powered by a still-beating Dragon heart, to create this weapon.
The gang hear some rumours, [[Ship Trapped In The Ice]] NW of [[Bremen]], and of a Cult in [[Caer Dineval]], [[Cult of Levistus]]. As it on their way they decide to check out the latter, heading to [[Caer Dineval]].
At the eponymous [[Caer Dineval Caer]] they find two strangely dressed guards wearing matching [[Levistus Amulet]]s, after some pressing they divulge that there is a cult but you have to be picked to join. [[Worb]] teleports inside to investigate but finds nothing interesting, the gang move on.
