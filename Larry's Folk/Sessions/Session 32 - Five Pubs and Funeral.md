# Session 32 - Five Pubs and Funeral
#### 2022-08-09 / 15th - 16th Hammer 1490 
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Don Fyre]], [[Depeche]], [[Jory Namaceam]], [[Vellynne Harpell]]

## Session Summary
After emerging victorious from the fight with the [[Chardalyn Dragon]], the gang are lauded as heroes, being offered free food and drink forever in [[Bremen]]. [[Dorgelbruff]] also bestows each of the gang a title, and a collective title "Heroes of Bremen". 
The gang celebrate by doing the famous 5 Pub barcrawl. The pubs are apparently all run by 5 siblings, who were left a pub each by their father. Each thinks they should be put in charge of them all and request the gang use their considerable sway in the town to make this so. On this barcrawl the gang get into a drinking contest, which leads to them getting varying levels of drunk, from [[Raisin]] who stops at a reasonable time, to [[Don Fyre]] who drank himself into the grave, leaving [[Depeche]] the winner. [[Jory Namaceam]] rocks up and replaces Don. 
After resting at the [[Buried Treasure Inn]], and encountering [[Shrodney Mulphoon]] againt, the gang forget to tell [[Dorgelbruff]] who they think should run the inns, and set off towards the [[Shifting Sea]].
