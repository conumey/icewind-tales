# Session 5 - Bryn Shander and Caer-Dineval
#### 2021-11-16 /  3rd Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Haberdash]]

## Session Summary
The gang head back to Bryn Shander and receive their reward from [[Marc]], no more work at this time. Talk to [[Danika Greysteel]]??
They head onwards to [[Caer Dineval]] on their way to [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. There they stop in at [[Uphill Climb]] for something to eat and talk to the innkeeper [[Hamhands Jig]]. He tells them there's no beer because the [[Easthaven]] [[Frozen Ferry]] doesn't run anymore because of the endless winter freezing [[Lac Dinneshere]], [[Where the Sun Gone]]. 
They learn [[Torgs]] are camped outside the town, presumably with [[Sethek]] in tow.
