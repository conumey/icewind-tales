# Negotiations and Gossip
## Session 4
#### 22021-11-09  / 2nd Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Haberdash]]

## Session Summary
The gang head to [[Bremen Town Hall]] and talk to the steward, [[Petunia Rumpus]], who informs them the speaker, [[Dorgelbruff]] is quite ill and cannot see them, and also he's out for a walk. Haberdash stays behind to be flirted with by the steward, while the gang retrieve him and put him back to bed, attempting to heal him of his illness but it is decided it is simply a case of "too old". 
Gang requests of the steward an agreement of supplying fish to Bryn Shander, the steward agrees but needs the speaker's ring to stamp it, which the gang acquires, and the [[Fish Dinner|agreement is made]]. 

The gang head back to targos and go to the inn, upstairs is strange noises, which is caused by [[Narth Maximum]] the town speaker who remains up there permanently, running the town from there instead of at [[Targos Town Hall]]. The steward of the town is [[Fungus Jig]].

A hardy woman, [[Seffett Trollbane]], hires the gang to kill a man who has been seen with no clothes on in the cold, killing people. Says he is "touched by the [[Frost Maiden]]", travels with [[Torgs]], lead by [[Torga Icefame]]. He murders in protest of the lottery system for the human sacrifices, which he says is corrupt as it never selects nobles, and so he kills nobles instead. Every 10 days he kills, in a different town every time. Targos victim was [[Humphbert Barrelboy]] who worked at [[Three Flag Sailing]]. [[Sethek]], [[The Cold Man]].

Gang goes to Three Flag Sailing to ask about the victim, the proprietor [[Ma Broth]] sells them broth and tells them about Humphbert.
