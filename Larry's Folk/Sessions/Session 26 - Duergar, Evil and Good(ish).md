# Session 26 - Duergar, Evil and Good(ish)
#### 2022-06-14 / 14th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Don Fyre]], [[Depeche]]

## Session Summary
The gang finishes off the duergar and explore, finding some treasure and being hurt by some traps. They also find a sympathetic Duergar, [[Grandolpha Muzgardt]] who wants [[Zardarok]] dead so wants to help the gang. Some of the Duergar in [[Sunblight]] are on her side. It is a temporary alliance in the grand scheme of things but now is not the time. More traps and more shitty treasure. 
Finding the second elevator, the gang is attacked by some animated plate armour.

## Recap of last session
![[Session 25 - Imminent Threat#^summary]]

## Log
- Start mid fight around 4:30am.
- The fight is ended without a scratch.
- Depeche watches for Duerger coming in behind while the gang investigate the barracks.
- The gang find an office with a stone desk, locked drawers. Don fails to pick the locks and delcares them locked by "Arcane Magicks"
- The gang smash the desk to bits, finding 20 gold and a notebook owned by a [[Nephrun]], detailing troop movements and stations, and a note, [[Zardarok]] thinks I'm plotting, if only I knew who was so I could stop them.
- The gang decides against a short rest, due to time constraints.
- Entering a room the gang finds a metal map of tentowns, with a little metal [[Chardalyn]] dragon on top of [[Sunblight]]. [[Depeche]] snaps off the dragon and stashes it.
- A lever on the table causes the rod previously attached to the dragon to show a route around [[Ten-Towns]], presumably the path of destruction.
- [[Dougan's Hole]] -> [[Good Mead]] -> [[Easthaven]] -> [[Caer Dineval]] -> [[Caer-Konig]] -> [[Termalaine]] -> [[Lonelywood]] -> [[Bremen]] -> [[Targos]] -> [[Bryn Shander]]
- [[Soren]] sends a message to [[Marc]] with the route, and he responds "Very strange this, I will do what I can but Bryn Shander is my priority. Messages will be sent, farewell."
- Into a room with a bed, there is a locked chest, Don fails to pick but [[Depeche]] smashes the lock with a maul. The chest contains treasures!
	- [[Dwarven Sandals]] Made From Obsidian 250g
	- Quilted [[Smoking Jacket]] Gemstones 500g
	- Malachite [[Beard Comb Set]] Inlaid With  7 Red Garnets 750g
	- Platinum [[Hookah]] Encrusted with Star Sapphires 2500g
	- [[Leather Scroll]]
- The room fills with gas after removing the scroll.
- Don attempts to get the trap to stop by reading the scroll out at it.
- Raising also tries this.
- Depeche jams the smoking jacket in the gas hole, and traps himself in a cupboard.
- The cupboard is a strange shrine with 7 skulls and a naked, bald, duergar woman with no facial features.
- Soren replaces the smoking jacket with the furs from the bed.
- Raisin replaces the furs with a balloon.
- Depeche attempts to take the statue and run, but it is cursed [[Chardalyn]] and so is psychically hurt a lot, and so drops and it and cowers in the corner of the cupboard.
- Soren rushes in and heals Depeche.
- Don wraps up the statue and stashes it. He identifies it as a depiction of the [[Deep Duerra]].
- The gang gangs up to heal depeche.
- Pressing further the gang finds a hole that could fit a dragon going from underground right out to the top of Sunblight.
- Entering another room the gang encounters some Duerger Chefs and an old woman.
- [[Grandolpha Muzgardt]], offers the gang some food, consisting of a big brain with legs.
- She has a miniature version of the [[Chardalyn Dragon]] as a defender.
- The broth is the specialty of their clan, the Graklstugh Brood.
- Don purifies his broth, but Depeche drinks unpurified.
- Grandolpha reveals she wants [[Zardarok]] killed, and has been plotting, the chefs are her bodyguards.
- It is not the time for the Duergar to take over the surface.
- Zardarok wants her to be his 4th wife, for the political power from her clan.
- The gang eat and get info from [[Grandolpha Muzgardt]] over the course of an hour.
- It is 6am.
- Grandolpha has allies who will help. 
- Zardarok is probably near the forge.
- Dragon Heart must be destroyed or it can be used to repair the [[Chardalyn Dragon]].
- Zardarok has been bringing creatures up from the underdark into the forge, including a big Myconid, which they use to reanimate corpses.
- Duergar hammerers, mech operating duergar.
- Down the hall are the rooms of [[Durth]] and [[Nildar]]
- In one of the boys rooms the chest is a mimic, Don gets stuck but the gang blast it to bits.
- In the other is a normal chest containing.
	- Ceramic Jug of Wine
	- Drinking Horn
	- Charcoal Sketch of Duergar (Mummy)
- Entering the eastern lift room, there are 4 suits of armour. Soren is enamoured but Depeche is immediately skeptical and fires an eldritch blast. They come to life and attack.
- The gang emerge victorious, but a bit battered.
- 6:15am.
