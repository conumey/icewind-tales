# Session 3 - The Bremen Coronation
#### 2021-11-02 / 2nd Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Haberdash]]

## Session Summary
The gang reach [[Targos]] and are greeted by [[Bod]] at the gate, they try claim there is a toll but fail because of the pure rage of [[Raisin]]. They look for Chiwinga, [[Find The Chiwingas]], as the [[Magic Lantern]] is glowing green and find a house beset by "fey creatures". In the house the gang meet [[Crome]], a crone who claims things are turning sour, neighbours turning on neighbours. The gang find chiwingas and spend a time interacting with them, trying to convince them to help with the eternal night, [[Where the Sun Gone]]. One of the chiwingas joins the gang and everyone is delighted, they name him [[Larry]].
Before moving on the gang heads to [[Triglio]], a "shop of normal goods" run by [[Jernome Stoops]], it's weird.
The gang meet [[Keeper Fryling]], whose husband seems to be missing, his loyal dog [[Boy]] has returned without him which is mighty odd, the gang agree to look for him once their business in [[Bremen]] is concluded, [[My Husband's Keeper]].
The gang head to the inn, meeting the inkeeper [[Oboid Tarnation]], and ??? [[Petunia Rumpus]].
Gang heads to Bremen, and heads to the jetty meeting [[Grrnskrr]] who offers them coppers for fish and [[Tali]] who asks them for notes and sketches of the creature in the lake.
The gang go out on the lake, fish for a bit, then encounter the creature. A brief fight happens before they realise the creature is sentient, parlay ensues. The gang name the creature [[Barnaby St. Clyde]] and crown him king of the lake and he agrees to stop destroying boats. He was told to destroy boats by the shaman who awakened him, [[Ravisin]], or she would take his newfound intelligence away. Unclear motives - [[Shaman of Chaos]]. [[Frost Maiden]] is mentioned as the cause of the endless night, [[Where the Sun Gone]].
