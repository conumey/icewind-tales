# Journey to the Cairn
## Session 7
#### 2021-12-10 / 3rd to 4th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Haberdash]], [[Don Fyre]]

## Session Summary
The gang head out immediately, claiming they can go all night. The journey is rough despite having a guide, and they decide to have a rest in a cave. In the morning the gang encounter an #Ice-Troll and attempt to defeat it, but it was far too strong and [[Haberdash]] is killed. [[Oyaminoktok]] shows up to save the gang and they use the opportunity to escape.

The gang is angry at [[Jarthur]] but he is unmoved. 

Under a tree, covered in snow, the gang encounter a strange old man who knows a lot about them. He introduces himself as [[Don Fyre]] the fish person and joins them, somewhat without the consent of the group.

The group reaches the base of the mountain and finds [[Garrett Fryling]]'s other dogs tied up, who they untie and promptly name [[Rangadanga]], [[Grape]], [[Gehhh Stupid Dog]], [[George]], [[The Fluffiest Dog]]. The sled is destroyed for firewood. [[My Husband's Keeper]].

The gang make their way up the mountain with varying degrees of success, taking the dogs with them, and finally find [[Garrett Fryling]], who is alone and injured(?), they are immediately set upon by two Mountain Cats.
