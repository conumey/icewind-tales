# Session 13 - There And Hag Again
#### 2022-02-09 / 6th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Don Fyre]], [[Worb]]

## Session Summary
Working their way through the cave to try find what happened to [[Gobber Murder]] and [[Humphbert Scripp]], [[Missing Fishermen]], the gang encounter wolves, and then eventually a large skeletal golem encased in ice. The golem begins to thaw at their prescence so they smash it to bits. Past the golem is [[Maud]], stirring a putrid stew in a cauldron. She's killed the fishermen and will kill the gang too unless one of them stays behind. The gang unanimously volunteer [[Don Fyre]] who does indeed stay behind. While leaving the cave, the gang encounter a strange creature who calls itself [[Worb]]. [[Worb]] was in the employ of [[Maud]] but has been replaced by [[Don Fyre]] and so he travels with the gang back to [[Easthaven]].
As they did not actually complete the task, the gang attempts to lie to [[Daveth Waylen]] about what was the cause of the disappearances, blaming wolves, which only half works as he requests that the gang find and kill the wolves, and bring back the bodies, which they agree to do, and so return to the [[Hag Cave]], and a fight ensues, with [[Don Fyre]] on the opposing side.
