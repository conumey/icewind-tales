# 16 - The Bugbearteers
#### 2022-03-01 / 7th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Worb]]

## Session Summary
[[Dzaan]] plans to travel the wastes with [[Krintaas]], but tells the gang to watch out for a group of wizards who are looking for him, [[Avarice]], [[Vellynne Harpell]], and [[Nass Lantomir]].

On the way out of the tower the gang bump into three Bugbears, [[Brekk]], [[Grok]], and [[Robert]] who originally did plan to kill and eat them but were easily convinced to help the gang to look for the red yeti in return for being able to eat it and also some payment.

[[Milboil]] and his boys find the Red Yeti first but make the mistake of attacking the gang when they find out they have an extreme wealth of gold on them, they are destroyed with only one survivor who agrees to tell [[Daveth Waylen]] at [[Easthaven]] it was [[Milboil]] who attacked first, so he is tied up and taken with them, back to town.
