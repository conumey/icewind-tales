## Session Summary
The gang fight the cats and win, but unfortunately in the fight [[Grape]] is killed. The gang climb the ice to try find the rest of Garrett's group, and find a cave at the top. The cave is filled with heads, severed in a similar fashion to [[Oobok]] in [[Missing Dwarf]]. The cave belongs to a Yeti family, who [[Don Fyre]] talks to and convinces them to let [[Perry Fishfinger]] go. The daddy yeti returns and isn't happy but the group escape unscathed. They climb further up the mountain and find the corpses of [[Bathroom Hammerhome]] and [[Astrix]], along with [[Astrix Spellbook]] and some [[Fancy Blue Boots]]. The gang head down the mountain
Soren makes a fancy new sled to get back to [[Caer Konig]].
