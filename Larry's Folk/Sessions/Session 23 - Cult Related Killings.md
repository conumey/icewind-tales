# Cult Related Killings
## Session 
#### 2022-05-17 / 11th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Depeche]], [[Don Fyre]]

## Session Summary
The gang find a room with a guard out front in the [[Caer Dineval Caer]] at [[Caer Dineval]], and convince them they're allowed in. Inside is the [[Scrannon Desieve]] who is ill, he says the cult are keeping him ill and using him to run the town by proxy. The gang decide this is enough justification and the cult must be stopped, they restore the speaker's health and go to see [[Kaldroth]]. Immediately [[Don Fyre]] casts a silence spell and so the only choice is melee combat, which [[Depeche]] and [[Raisin]] quickly take care of, [[Kaldroth]] dies. As he dies his body is encased in ice. After this the gang systematically take out most of the cult, sparing any townspeople that were in service of the cult not by choice. [[Depeche]] instructs his horrible dead goblin ghost to find and kill anyone wearing the [[Levistus Amulet]], and off it goes. Reaching the [[Scrannon Desieve]]'s room, the gang find the guard in the room with the speaker hostage, and urge them to very quickly take off the amulet if they want to live. They aqcuiese in a panic and immediately turn to a block of ice. The gang then head into the basement to explore, and find a tiefling woman, [[Avarice]], writing in a book. She is annoyed that they have killed the cult but only because she will have to find another place to do her work, and that if the gang did kill the cult then it was [[Levistus]]' will. The gang insist on seeing what she is doing and so accidentally start a fight, but she is very strong. [[Depeche]] de-escalates the situation and [[Avarice]] leaves. Exploring further the gang find prisoners, the previous butler and other staff of the [[Scrannon Desieve]]. Freeing them they go to see the speaker, when they realise some cultists have escaped with the dogs and sled, and set off to pursue.
