# It's all Netherese to me
## Session 
#### 2022-02-22 / 7th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Worb]]

## Session Summary
The gang start the day by meeting up with [[Milboil]] in the middle of town to begin the [[Hunt For The Red Yeti]]. 

The group find a strange doorway and so decide to investigate, and find that it is a strange tower which they are at the top of, despite being in a literal race they investigate further. In the tower were a number of strange creatures, and in a saferoom near the bottom they encounter [[Dzaan]], or who turns out to be a simulacrum of [[Dzaan]] and his undead bodyguard [[Krintaas]]. [[Dzaan]] wants to use the tower's Netherese technology to turn himself into a real boy, but there's a powerful creature downstairs. The gang kills the creature and [[Dzaan]] uses the tower to become real, he explains the tower can turn any illusion into reality, and the gang use this to create a phenomenal amount of money.
