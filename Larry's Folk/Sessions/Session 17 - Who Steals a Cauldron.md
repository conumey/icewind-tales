# Session 17 - Who Steals a Cauldron
#### 2022-03-08 / 7th to 8th Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Worb]]

## Session Summary
Back at [[Easthaven]] the gang explain the business with [[Milboil]] and the [[Hunt For The Red Yeti]] to [[Daveth Waylen]] who believes them thanks to the prisoner. The bugbears [[Grok]], [[Brek]], and [[Robert]] decide to become a mercenary band called [[The Three Bugbearteers]] and go off to do that.
The gang settles in at [[Easthaven Town Hall]] to defend the [[Cauldron of Plenty]], [[Guard the Cauldron]]. They do some exploring and find a [[Poetry Book]] in the library, some guards playing cards downstairs, and an extremely ominous figurehead statue that is made of [[Chardalyn]]. Chained to the statue is a woman, [[Lac Dinneshere Treasure]], who the gang promptly kill with no deductive reasoning to what it could mean. [[Worb]] touches the statue and goes weird.
After a while of quiet the gang go and check on the cauldron, only to find it currently being stolen, fighting the thieves they chase them outside where they have axebeak mounts and leave only one alive for questioning. The gang get their reward for guarding the cauldron and head to finish up their business in [[Easthaven]].
