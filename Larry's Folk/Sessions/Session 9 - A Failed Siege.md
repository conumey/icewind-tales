# A Failed Siege
## Session 9
#### 2022-01-04 / 4th to 5th of Hammer 1490
##### [[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Don Fyre]]

## Session Summary
The group return to [[Caer Konig]] and rest up at [[The Northern Light]], meeting [[Annie]] and [[Allie]] before doing some investigating about [[Missing Gubbins]]. [[Glenny]]'s goats were taken. The group find tracks from the goat pen and follow them, finding a large [[Duergar Fortress]]. They attempt to lay siege but are beaten back, the inhabitants being duergar and in giant form they prove to be too much, and so return to town to recruit help.
