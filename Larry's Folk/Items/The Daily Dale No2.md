### DRAGON CALAMITY SUNDERS DALE!!!!!!!!
#### DEATH TOLL UNCOUNTABLE
Early yesterday morning a terrible cry was heard in [[Dougan's Hole]]. From somewhere in the mountains of the [[Spine of The World]], the night quiet was broken by the cry of a terrible mechanical beast. The [[Chardalyn Dragon|dragon]] that has so damaged all our lives and livelihoods first descended on [[Dougan's Hole]] before descending upon [[Good Mead]], [[Easthaven]], [[Caer Dineval]], [[Caer Konig]], [[Termalaine]] and [[Lonelywood]]. A brief account of the events in each of the mentioned towns is as follows:

###### [[Dougan's Hole]]
Every structure in the town was destroyed, barring the famous [[Stones of Thruun]]. Twenty-five of the total fifty residents perished, though the remaining survivors, including Speaker [[Durmoot]] escaped to [[Bryn Shander]].

###### [[Good Mead]]
Every structure except the mead hall was destroyed. Twenty-five, one quarter of the township, hid in the nearby woods to escape the dragon before making their way to [[Bryn Shander]].

###### [[Easthaven]]
Approximately half of the buildings in [[Easthaven]] have been destroyed, including the [[White Lady Inn]], the [[Wet Trout]], and the docks. Among the dead are [[Captain Aggie]] of the town guard, [[Boatman Boathands]], [[Minerva Myskjin]] (proprietor of the [[Wet Trout]]), and Speaker [[Daveth Waylen]] (who was killed not by the dragon, but by several #Duergar searching the town hall, looking for who knows what). [[Ricardo the Sultry]] was badly injured but intends to restore and run the [[White Lady Inn]], should he be presented the chance.

###### [[Caer Dineval]]
The only survivors of the attack on [[Caer Dineval]] were those lucky enough to be within the [[Caer Dineval Caer|castle]] walls. The [[Chardalyn Dragon|dragon]] seemed only interested in destroying the rest of the town, barely glancing at the castle as it spent an hour in everywhere else. Many of the townsfolk were murdered by a band of #Duergar emerging from the seemingly abandoned tavern, [[Dinev's Rest]], including the much beloved [[Hamhands Jig]], owner of the [[Uphill Climb]].

###### [[Caer Konig]]
The tragedy of [[Caer Konig]] was not that every building in town was destroyed. It was not that the sisters [[Annie]] and [[Allie]] were killed when [[The Northern Light]] collapsed upon them. It was not that [[Atenas Swift]] of [[Frozenfar Expeditions]] was killed when trying to save people with his dog sleds. The tragedy of [[Caer Konig]] was that as the town was destroyed, it’s speaker and greatest fighter [[Tovus]] was asleep, drunk in a snow heap outside town. Long may his shame endure. Fortunately, the taciturn [[Jarthur]] had assembled his magnificent airship and managed to save fifty people using netting and ropes to carry more than his balloon could usually carry.

###### [[Termalaine]]
The townsfolk of [[Termalaine]] fled both to [[Bremen]], across [[Maer Dualdon]], and into the [[Termalaine Mines|gem mines]] at the northwest of the town. After six hours, the dragon could not oust those hiding in the [[Termalaine Mines|mine]]. After it had departed though, duergar saboteurs emerged and collapsed the entrance to the [[Termalaine Mines|mine]], and the survivors are still trapped within.

###### [[Lonelywood]]
[[Lonelywood]] has faired perhaps the best of any of the towns destroyed. While every building there has been demolished, their close proximity to [[Termalaine]] and the easy escape route of the [[Maer Dualdon|maer]] meant that all the residents of [[Lonelywood]] knew of the dragon’s imminent attack and could escape to [[Bremen]] before the beast reached them.

###### [[Bremen]]
It was at [[Bremen]] that the dragon met it’s end. The heroes of the group [[Larry's Folk]] assisted in evacuating the town before making their stand against the creature, using strength and magic to destroy the beast before it could do any more harm. The people of [[Tentowns]] can do little to repay this deed. Given how little time there was to prepare, it is a miracle that the adventurers were able to react so quickly and decisively.
