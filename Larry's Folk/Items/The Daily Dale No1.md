### TRADE TENSION ENDS IN BREMEN
Tensions have been high in [[Bremen]] over the past few weeks between the recently crowned King of the Lac, his grace [[Barnaby St. Clyde|Barnaby St. Clyde I]], and [[Dorgelbruff|Speaker Shalescar]], due to the embargo on fishing imposed by the former on the [[Maer Dualdon]] town stead. After weeks of nautical espionage conducted by [[Barnaby St. Clyde|His Grace]], a parlay between the rival leaders took place on the [[Bremen]] dockside where a heated altercation took place between the secretary of the Speaker, one [[Petunia Rumpus|Petunia]] REDACTED, verbally accosted the newly crowned king, calling [[Barnaby St. Clyde|His Grace]] a “big grey idiot” and “a handless gay”. Shocking onlookers, the usually reserved [[Dorgelbruff|Speaker]] leaned out of his palanquin and struck the cheeky [[Petunia Rumpus|secretary]] a mighty swat about the ear. After a rocky start, the meeting of minds on the [[Docks|docks]] took a further four hours of intense back and forth, [[Barnaby St. Clyde|The King]] arguing for the denizens of the [[Lac Dinneshere|lac]], and the speaker for the townsfolk throughout the dale dependent on [[Bremen]]’s fishing supply. The agreement decided upon was as follows: the people of Bremen are free to fish the [[Lac Dinneshere|Lac]] as required provided that the townsfolk provide regular entertainments on the shoreside for the [[Barnaby St. Clyde|king]] to enjoy. These frivolities must include, but are not limited to juggling, poetry readings, pig races/rodeo, and theatrical performances of local events where at least some of the participants are dressed as fish. As hand shook fin a cheer rose from the crowd and groups hurried off to prepare fishing gear and performance kit alike. When asked for comment [[Barnaby St. Clyde|His Grace the King of the Lac]] said “It’s great to see so many fans out here today, it was a great match, solid performance from everyone involved and has really set us up nicely for the season”. It is unclear what this means, thought this [[Tali|reporter]] is sure that the understanding of this, and many other of [[Barnaby St. Clyde|His Grace]]’s musings will be revealed in his upcoming biography, available at most reputable general stores. - [[Tali]], Wildlife researcher and Royal biographer.

### BUGBEAR MERCS RECRUIT MEMBER
The region’s newest mercenary group, [[The Three Bugbearteers|The Three Bugbear-teers]], has gained a new member, though this newbie is not of the gobloid persuasion, but is, in fact, a member of the post life community. [[Krintaas|Krintaas the Wight]] hails from “ages ago” and is the former bodyguard of the criminal wizard [[Dzaan|Dzaan the Red]]. He lost touch with his former employer when [[Dzaan]] “turned into a pile of black goo” while walking in the wilderness, an event about which [[Krintaas]] refused to comment further. As regular readers of the Dale Daily will know, [[Dzaan|The Red Wizard]] was put to death in the town of [[Easthaven]] for the crime of multiple murder, killing a group of adventurers whom he had hired to assist him, another topic which the hulking [[Krintaas]] was reticent to divulge upon. When asked for comment, the leader of the [[The Three Bugbearteers|Bugbear-teers]], [[Brekk]], said “He can reach the top shelves and doesn’t eat so we keep him. If he tries to goo us too we’d clogger him good and piss his bones” after which he pulled off [[Krintaas]]’ left arm and threw it into the bushes, causing the wight to bashfully retrieve it. [[The Three Bugbearteers|The Three Bugbear-teers]] (plus [[Krintaas]]) can usually be found in [[Bryn Shander]] and the connected towns, available to hire at competitive prices for guaranteed results with minimal mess. - [[Robert]], #Bugbear

### GOBLINS GOBLINS GOBLINS GOBLINS
#### Lock away your daughters, for the green menace is rising!!
No #Chicken coop, naïve merchant, or unattended baby is safe! Speakers throughout the Dale have been idle in their suppression of the vermin menace that has grown to disgusting proportions in recent months and the fruit of this indolence is being reaped on every quiet track and woodland copse. Not since the summer of 65DR has the #Goblin threat been so prominent in the region, with many suspecting that the squat freaks have gathered in some sort of society in the mountains under some ghastly leader. I shudder to think of the world our children will grow up into. A world where the sight of green skin is as common as the sight of Kurtis Mayhew’s escaped goats, you own too many Kurt, and they keep getting into my root cellar! BUILD A BETTER FENCE ALREADY. What’s the point in all these wandering adventurers if they don’t deal with the problems that affect normal people? It’s been ages since I’ve seen my sister in [[Dougan's Hole]], but I’ll be damned if I’m willing to risk being some gobbo’s strumpet so I can go see her.
