# Search for Ythryn 

[[Ythryn]] is the lost city of the #Netherese.

[[Vellynne Harpell]] is looking for it, along with the other members of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. She wants to be the first.

She tells the gang that information about it might be contained in the [[Codicil of the White]], which is in [[Grimskalle]], home of the [[Frost Maiden]], which lies somewhere within the [[Shifting Sea]]. To reach it the gang must first find [[Raghead Glacier]].
