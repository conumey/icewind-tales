[[Ricardo the Sultry]] told the gang of treasure in the lake, that only the [[Lady of the Lake]] knows the location of. 

He held a seance in [[White Lady Inn]] to commune but got no info.

During [[Guard the Cauldron]] the gang saw [[Lady of the Lake]] tied to the [[Chardalyn Figurehead]] and had another chance to ask but did not, and killed her.
