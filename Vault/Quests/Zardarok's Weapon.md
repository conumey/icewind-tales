[[Zardarok]] is searching for as much [[Chardalyn]] as possible to create a weapon with the intention of destroying [[Ten-Towns]], so that the duergar can take over. He is based in a fortress south of [[Ten-Towns]] called [[Sunblight]].

[[Zardarok]] is using the Forge of Sunblight to create the weapon, which is powered by the still-beating heart of a Dragon.

[[Duergar Fortress]] is filled with duergar in the service of [[Zardarok]].

[[Hethel Acoran]] tells a prophecy that a terrible decision will have to be made when the gang reach [[Sunblight]]. Another prophecy that [[Zardarok]] thinks he is king of the duergar and a conduit of great power but neither are true.

Upon reaching [[Sunblight]], a [[Chardalyn Dragon]] rises from the fortress and heads towards [[Ten-Towns]], in the direction of [[Bryn Shander]].
