After retrieving the [[Cauldron of Plenty]] from [[Maud]] in [[Hag Cave]], [[Daveth Waylen]] purchases it from the gang, with part of the agreement being they must defend it from being stolen overnight.

The gang defend the cauldron, having to deal with a ghostly [[Lady of the Lake]], and then would-be burglars from [[Targos]].
