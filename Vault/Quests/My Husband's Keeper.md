[[Garrett Fryling]] is missing after taking a group of people to, and up, [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. His dog [[Boy]] has returned without him which must mean something is wrong. 

[[Attenus Swift]] at [[Frozenfar Expeditions]] says they were looking for a Goliath Werebear, [[Oyaminoktok]], and that the group included a Goliath called [[Mokingo]].

[[Garrett Fryling]] was found on the mountain, injured. His group included [[Astrix]], [[Mokingo]], and [[Perry Fishfinger]]. 

Only Perry survived, though the corpse of an apparent [[Bathroom Hammerhome]] was found on the top of the mountain.

[[Garrett Fryling]] returned with his dogs to [[Keeper Fryling]] in [[Targos]], where they await the group.
