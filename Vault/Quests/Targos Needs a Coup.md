The speaker of [[Targos]], [[Narth Maximum]], is an unsavoury character. He sent agents to try steal the [[Cauldron of Plenty]] from [[Easthaven]].

[[Daveth Waylen]] has agreed to reward the gang if they get elected speaker in his place.

[[Duvessa Shane]] has been told of the misdeeds and will call a meeting of the council of speakers to discuss it.
