# Session  20
2022-04-19 / 9th to 10th Hammer 1490
[[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Worb]], [[Depeche]]

## Session Summary
Before they head out to look for the power source [[Alien Sex Zoogaloo]], alarms go off in the ship and the Mind Flayers say they are under attack. The crew man the only working Ballistae and defend the ship from ?????
They head out in the direction of [[Termalaine]], but before long a nasty snowstorm blows in, and after a little bit of walking, tied together, part of the rope goes slack. No-one saw or heard anything but [[Tangkwunu]] is gone, his belongings strewn. It is clear he was taken by the [[White Wyrm]]. The gang decide to rest out the rest of the storm in a conjured hut, when a hot air balloon lands not far from them. Inside is [[Depeche]] who humbly asks for help, which they provide. Resting overnight in the conjured hut. Without much choice [[Depeche]] agrees to accompany the gang to [[Termalaine]] and immediately has the role of leader, thrust with force upon him by [[Worb]]. 
The hot air balloon is full of holes, but [[Jarthur]] things he can fix it, so the gang uses the basket as a makeshift cart, pulled by creatures from the [[Bag of Tricks, Grey]].
[[Depeche]] mentions he saw a [[Goblin Fortress]] on the way into the dale that attacked his balloon.
On their way to [[Termalaine]] the gang encounter a band of Orcs, who would attack if not for [[Soren]], who has an amulet that can summon the ghost of their dead warchief. After speaking a bit the gang tells them about the sex zoo and points them towards the ship.
It turns out [[Termalaine]] is a mining town, and so the mines would likely be where they will find the power source. There is brief talk of buying the mine but it isn't clear who suggested this. The speaker of [[Termalaine]], [[Orus Mashtew]] informs them that the [[The Mines]] are infested with Kobolds who potentially came up from the underdark, and that if the gang could clear them out they could have the power source if they found it, as it would rightfully belong to the town if it was in the [[The Mines]]. The gang agrees.
