# Session  22
2022-05-11 / 10th to 11th Hammer 1490
[[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Worb]], [[Depeche]], [[Don Fyre]]

## Session Summary
Reaching the ship at last, there are Orcs everywhere, and briefly there is fear that they have killed the Mind Flayers but it turns out they're going with them to the sex zoo. The power source is handed over and in reward the gang are given two [[Laser Pistol]]s. [[Worb]] decides to leave with the aliens too.
[[Don Fyre]] returns, different somehow and rejoins the party like he never left.
The gang stop in [[Caer-Konig]] to rest, and buy pies and get free pies from [[Glenny]]. [[Jarthur]] remains the town, asking the gang to take a business proposition to [[Boffy]] for him, for a magic hot air balloon taxi business.
On the road to [[Caer-Dineval]] to go talk to the [[Cult of Levistus]] again, they encounter an old woman pulling a large bag, the gang offer to help and are quickly overrun by Goblins. The gang make quick work of them and search the bodies for clues to what they're doing in the area, finding a letter [[Goblin Letter]] instructing them to introduce themselves.
Moving on to the [[Caer]] in [[Caer-Dineval]] the guards apologise as they were told after the gang left that they were indeed allowed inside before, and welcome them inside now. The gang meets with the leader of the cult, [[Kaldroth]], who tells them the cult is in service of [[Levistus]] and the members will be spared when his hellish fury is unleashed, and that as the gang are in service of Him too they have free reign of the [[Caer]], but they should go talk to [[Hethel Acoran]] before they do anything else as she will die soon.
The seer tells the group she will die after reciting her prophecies to them, and so any questions should be asked before that, not many are asked.
The prophecies are given, both relating to [[Zardarok]], [[Zardarok's Weapon]]. [[Hethel Acoran]] dies.
