# Session 6
2021-11-29 / 3rd Hammer 1490
[[Raisin]], [[Soren]], [[Tangkwunu]], [[Haberdash]]

## Session Summary
The gang go outside the town to speak to [[Torgs]], they ask where [[Sethek]] is and somehow kinda learn this while also pissing them off and being menaced into leaving.
The gang finds [[Sethek]] and talk to him, deciding whether to kill him or not, he tells the gang he serves and is blessed by the [[Frost Maiden]] and kills because corrupting the lottery is cheating her of what she is owed. The gang attack and kill him, but he rises from the dead in a freezing hoarfrost ressurection, they chop him down again and set him on fire in order to finish him off for good.
The gang head north to [[Caer-Konig]], where they find a drunken silver dragonborn sleeping in the snow outside a tavern. He turns out to be the speaker of the town, [[Tovus]], and was "Keeping Guard" as the lantern outside [[The Northern Light]] had recently been stolen along with various other valuables, [[Missing Gubbins]].
The gang pops into [[Hook, Line, and Sinker]] for a free half pint from [[Glenny]].
At Frozenfar Expeditions the gang gets some info about the group they are looking for from [[Attenus Swift]], [[My Husband's Keeper]]. For a fee the gang hire [[Attenus Swift]]'s employee as a guide to the mountain, his name is [[Jarthur]].
